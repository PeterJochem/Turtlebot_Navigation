REMEMEBR that the angles in the transforms are entered in degrees and under the hood converted to radians
inputs/test1.txt contains two Transforms2D, T_ab and T_bc. The main.cpp program will read these in and output frame T_ab, T_ba, T_bc, T_cb, T_ac, T_ca. <br />
 
In inputs/test1.txt I list the frames in order T_ab, T_bc <br />
In outputs/test1.txt - I list the following frames in the order: T_ab, T_ba, T_bc, T_cb, T_ac, T_ca. Each Transform2D is listed <br /> 
```W_dot 
X_dot 
Y_dot```
