# Description
This ROS package describes a differential drive robot via a xacro and URDF file. I also included a simple launchfile to visualize the robot's geometry

## How to View Robot
Run ```roslaunch nuturtle_description view_diff_drive.launch``` with (optional) arguments use_jsp_gui - this runs the joint state publisher with its GUI and lets the user manipulate the joint angles of the robot

### Files in Package
Add a brief description of each file present in this repo
